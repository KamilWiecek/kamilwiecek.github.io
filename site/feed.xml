                <title>How I‚Äôll choose what product to build</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll divide the process into two main stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;creating-a-list-of-ideas-and-initial-selection&quot;&gt;Creating a list of ideas and initial selection&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the recommendation from Peter Levels‚Äô book Make, I‚Äôll focus on problems I‚Äôve personally encountered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first step, I‚Äôll create a rough list of problems and potential product ideas that come to mind. Then I‚Äôll narrow it down to a maximum of three ideas for deeper analysis. The goal is to find something that solves a real problem and has a chance of actually being useful to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I‚Äôll describe these products on my blog and ask for feedback in places where I can find potential users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/02-choosing-product-common-what-i-d-like-and-what-somoene-would-pay.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Overlap between &apos;What I would like to build&apos; and &apos;What someone would pay for&apos; ‚Äî highlighting the sweet spot as potential product to build&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;describing-the-three-selected-product-ideas&quot;&gt;Describing the Three Selected Product Ideas&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each product description will include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name and Description&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì A short summary of the product and the problem it solves. I‚Äôll explain why the problem is important and how solving it could help people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target Audience&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì Who will benefit the most from this product.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition and Differentiation&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì What similar solutions already exist and how my product will be different or better.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Model&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì How I plan to make money from this product and what costs I expect.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing Ideas&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì How I could get people interested in the product.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerns and Challenges&lt;/strong&gt; ‚Äì What I‚Äôm worried about and what might be hard during the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;main-goal-for-may-2025&quot;&gt;Main Goal for May 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for this month is to clearly describe these ideas using the structure above and define what I can quickly build to test market interest ‚Äî a scope of work for an MVP. It‚Äôs important to check as early as possible if the market really needs the solution, before I invest more time and resources into it.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Why am I going to build a product?</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The list will be sharp and to the point, without any filler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I‚Äôll have full decision-making power over what I do and how I do it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I enjoy pursuing goals I set for myself. After completing a demanding AI course and an algotrading bot project, I‚Äôm looking for a new, bigger challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My favorite part of professional work is designing and building systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is one of two paths I‚Äôve been considering for years. It seems less risky than the other one‚Äîbuilding my own service-based company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôve always had a few product ideas in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to do something beyond working for someone else. The main stage of building my professional career is already behind me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nothing truly bad will happen if I fail ‚Äî at worst, I‚Äôll gain valuable experience and learn something.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm inspired by people who have done it, like Troy Hunt and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot;&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt; project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was inspired by Peter Levels‚Äô book Make, in which he shares his experiences building startups solo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the future, I‚Äôd like to be able to say: ‚ÄúI once built my own product, even though I wasn‚Äôt sure it would work out.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôd like to build a personal brand along the lines of ‚Äúhe makes cool stuff.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe I‚Äôll even make some money from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, this blog entry will also serve as a place I can return to whenever I need a reminder of why I started, especially in moments when motivation runs low.&lt;/p&gt;
