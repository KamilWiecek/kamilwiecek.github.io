                <title>Why am I going to build a product?</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The list will be sharp and to the point, without any filler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ll have full decision-making power over what I do and how I do it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I enjoy pursuing goals I set for myself. After completing a demanding AI course and an algotrading bot project, I’m looking for a new, bigger challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My favorite part of professional work is designing and building systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is one of two paths I’ve been considering for years. It seems less risky than the other one—building my own service-based company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve always had a few product ideas in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to do something beyond working for someone else. The main stage of building my professional career is already behind me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nothing truly bad will happen if I fail — at worst, I’ll gain valuable experience and learn something.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m inspired by people who have done it, like Troy Hunt and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot;&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt; project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was inspired by Peter Levels’ book Make, in which he shares his experiences building startups solo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the future, I’d like to be able to say: “I once built my own product, even though I wasn’t sure it would work out.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’d like to build a personal brand along the lines of “he makes cool stuff.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe I’ll even make some money from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog entry will also be a place I come back to in moments when I lack motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
