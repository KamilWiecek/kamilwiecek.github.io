                <title>✅ How I plan to validate Trading Signals Auditor idea in the real world</title>
                <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;-first-things-first-validating-interest-before-building-it-all&quot;&gt;📢 First Things First: Validating Interest Before Building It All&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-want-to-find-out-if-anyone-is-even-interested-in-it&quot;&gt;I want to find out if anyone is even interested in it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that, I want to start marketing the product by publishing interesting insights from analyzing trading signal groups — on Twitter, Reddit, and niche forums.  For this, I need to collect and analyze the trading signals, only then I can start sharing my findings publicly and for free, directing people to my landing page with a waitlist option&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a challenge for me, but while doing all the above tasks, I need to focus above all on the time required to implement them, avoiding overengineering and aiming for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-the-goal-is-to-start-collecting-interested-users-on-the-waitlist-as-soon-as-possible&quot;&gt;🎯 The goal is to start collecting interested users on the waitlist as soon as possible.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s why I’ll start by planning the tasks that will get me there.&lt;/strong&gt; I will divide it to milestones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;-what-must-be-the-outcome-of-my-next-actions&quot;&gt;📋 What Must Be the Outcome of My Next Actions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-collected-trading-signals&quot;&gt;📊 Collected Trading Signals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I will prepare scripts that automatically download and process signals from popular groups sharing free trading signals. These scripts will run locally, and the data will be saved in a SQLite database. Initially, I will focus on the most popular groups and simple solutions to quickly launch the data collection process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;️️-verification-of-the-effectiveness-of-the-collected-signals&quot;&gt;🕵️‍♂️ Verification of the Effectiveness of the Collected Signals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step will be to perform backtesting of the collected signals using historical market data. This way, I will determine how effective the signals were and what potential profit or loss they could have generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-readiness-to-let-people-join-the-waitlist-for-the-product&quot;&gt;📨 Readiness to Let People Join the Waitlist for the Product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will create a simple landing page that briefly presents the product, shows sample visualizations, and includes a blog with conclusions from the analyses. Users will be able to join the waitlist by providing their email to receive updates about the product’s availability and interesting insights from the analyses. This way, I’ll be able to build engagement and keep potential users informed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;️-time-to-build&quot;&gt;🛠️ Time to Build&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s time for implementation. For each of the 3 milestones described above—ultimately leading to the start of product promotion and encouraging sign-ups to the waitlist—I will prepare a more detailed task list and begin the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>📈 Trading Signals Auditor - The First Product Idea I’m Most Excited About</title>
                <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;️-what-is-signals-auditor-and-what-problem-does-it-solve&quot;&gt;🙅‍♀️ What is Signals Auditor And What Problem Does It Solve?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signals Auditor is a tool that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reveals the real performance of investment signals from various sources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reduces the risk of wasting money on dishonest signal providers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rhelps minimize losses caused by inaccurate signals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rsupports conscious decisions about buying signals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rexposes scammy trading signal providers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;verifies signals in a practical way by trading selected signals on a real exchange&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;-who-will-benefit-from-this-product&quot;&gt;🎯 Who Will Benefit From This Product&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product is targeted at investors of all experience levels who don’t want to get scammed out of their money by paying for or using low-quality signals. Instead, they want to make a conscious and informed decision about whether to use such signals and risk their hard-earned money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;-what-about-the-competition&quot;&gt;🏆 What about the competition?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t found any solutions on the market that truly audit the effectiveness of trading signals. A potential customer can only rely on what the signal groups claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly where Signals Auditor comes in — independent, transparent, and data-driven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;-business-model-and-costs-behind-the-product&quot;&gt;💰 Business Model and Costs Behind the Product&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to the real trading signals results will be paid — a subscription model that also gives users influence over the product’s development by allowing them to suggest and choose new features and groups whose signal sources will be audited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The costs include my time spent on developing the product, small IT infrastructure expenses, and the cost of memberships in paid signal groups that will be audited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;-how-i-want-to-promote-it&quot;&gt;📣 How I Want to Promote It&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build an MVP with a clearly defined scope in the coming days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask for feedback on Reddit — to check if the product makes sense, especially since part of the functionality is ready and I can share stats on signal group reliability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a Twitter profile and share analysis results during MVP development, including in trading-related threads.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Post weekly or monthly stats — e.g., for specific tokens — on the blog and in communities where traders gather.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up a landing page with a “buy” button — really a waitlist sign-up with a potential launch promotion. According to Peter Levels, it’s a good way to validate real interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;️-what-worries-me-the-most-about-launching-this-product&quot;&gt;⚠️ What Worries Me the Most About Launching This Product&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two main concerns about this product: I’m wondering if I’ll be able to reach people who are interested in it, and I’m also worried about how the owners of the groups that perform poorly will react — especially since it will be known who is behind the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;-opportunities&quot;&gt;🚀 Opportunities&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to build a product from A to Z, and that alone already gives me satisfaction, so this project is, above all, a personal challenge for me. I plan to act in the spirit of Building in Public, so I will regularly share my progress — maybe I’ll also gather some interest and feedback along the way. And even if it doesn’t work out commercially — I’ll be left with knowledge, experience, a toolbox of tools built during development, and data that — if it’s worth it — I can share publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;️-whats-my-next-step&quot;&gt;🛠️ What’s my next step&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the post &lt;a href=&quot;how-will-i-choose-product-to-build&quot;&gt;📋 How I’ll choose what product to build&lt;/a&gt;  I planned to describe all potential products first, but I’ve already decided to start building Signals Auditor. That’s why my next step will be to plan the MVP features, breaking them down into milestones and tasks needed to release the first iteration of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>📋 How I’ll choose what product to build </title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ll divide the process into two main stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;-creating-a-list-of-ideas-and-initial-selection&quot;&gt;📋 Creating a list of ideas and initial selection&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the recommendation from Peter Levels’ book Make, I’ll focus on problems I’ve personally encountered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first step, I’ll create a rough list of problems and potential product ideas that come to mind. Then I’ll narrow it down to a maximum of three ideas for deeper analysis. The goal is to find something that solves a real problem and has a chance of actually being useful to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I’ll describe these products on my blog and ask for feedback in places where I can find potential users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-box&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/02-choosing-product-common-what-i-d-like-and-what-somoene-would-pay.jpg&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Overlap between &apos;What I would like to build&apos; and &apos;What someone would pay for&apos; — highlighting the sweet spot as potential product to build&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;-describing-the-three-selected-product-ideas&quot;&gt;📝 Describing the Three Selected Product Ideas&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each product description will include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name and Description&lt;/strong&gt; – A short summary of the product and the problem it solves. I’ll explain why the problem is important and how solving it could help people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target Audience&lt;/strong&gt; – Who will benefit the most from this product.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition and Differentiation&lt;/strong&gt; – What similar solutions already exist and how my product will be different or better.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Model&lt;/strong&gt; – How I plan to make money from this product and what costs I expect.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing Ideas&lt;/strong&gt; – How I could get people interested in the product.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerns and Challenges&lt;/strong&gt; – What I’m worried about and what might be hard during the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-main-goal-for-may-2025&quot;&gt;✅ Main Goal for May 2025&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for this month is to clearly describe these ideas using the structure above and define what I can quickly build to test market interest — a scope of work for an MVP. It’s important to check as early as possible if the market really needs the solution, before I invest more time and resources into it.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>🤔 Why am I going to build a product?</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;The list will be sharp and to the point, without any filler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ll have full decision-making power over what I do and how I do it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I enjoy pursuing goals I set for myself. After completing a demanding AI course and an algotrading bot project, I’m looking for a new, bigger challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My favorite part of professional work is designing and building systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is one of two paths I’ve been considering for years. It seems less risky than the other one—building my own service-based company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve always had a few product ideas in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to do something beyond working for someone else. The main stage of building my professional career is already behind me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nothing truly bad will happen if I fail — at worst, I’ll gain valuable experience and learn something.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m inspired by people who have done it, like Troy Hunt and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&quot;&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt; project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was inspired by Peter Levels’ book Make, in which he shares his experiences building startups solo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the future, I’d like to be able to say: “I once built my own product, even though I wasn’t sure it would work out.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’d like to build a personal brand along the lines of “he makes cool stuff.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe I’ll even make some money from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, this blog entry will also serve as a place I can return to whenever I need a reminder of why I started, especially in moments when motivation runs low.&lt;/p&gt;
